I'm piecing together the parts needed to build a global platform for organizing spontaneous headphone dance parties in the streets.

We tried creating that with my last startup and failed. For some reason, reflexions on how it could have been designed are still running in the back of my mind. I must admit I like the technical challenge! I think I might have the right recipe now. Here are most of the parts:


### DJ Editor

Lets you...
- Slice a segment of a track
- Enter it's bpm and key
- Arrange the order of the segments
- Choose an effect for each transition (with presets)

It will...
- Adjust the tempo of each segment (following a curve)
- Collate the audio files together
- Encode the file to a 256 kbps .mp3
- Upload it

Mixes are 15 minutes max.


### Voting system

Let's dancers who live within a city vote on their favorite mix this week.
It's one vote per dancer per week.


### Client app

A mobile app.

- Let's you vote on the weekly mix
- Downloads the winning track whenever you are connected to wifi
- Sends you notifications when critical mass is possible
- Let's you RSVP within 5 minutes to the potential street party
- Notifies you if there's critical mass, with the location of the event. (a public space located closest to the middle point between all participants)
- Shows you how to get to that location
- Starts playing the sound file at the beginning of the event 
- Let's you 'like' tracks while they are playing
- At the end, offers you the option to connect to other participants (ala Tinder)


### City unlocking

The app is only available in cities that have been unlocked.
To unlock a city, a minimum number of new users must register within a time frame.
