All trucks are coming from somewhere,
All trucks are going somewhere.

Some truckers, when asked "Might you be heading west?",
are pleasant.
others are unpleasant,
others are neither pleasant neither unpleasant.

Spending time here, you come to notice:

- the different trucking companies;
- the different types of load;
- the different immatriculations;
- when truckers are riding with someone, or with a dog;
- when truckers are coming to spend some time, or passing through

Through observations and discussions, you come to understand the different dynamics at work. What is common, what is rare. What is possible, what is impossible.

You start to feel at home and at ease, through better understanding.

All trucks come.
All trucks go.
