The short answer is no, they are not.

And **that’s a good thing.**

People have a tendency to separate what happens in day to day life from what happens in a hypnotherapy session. To believe that what a hypnotist helps you do is fundamentally different than what you do outside of their office.

Although the context in which therapeutic hypnosis happens is particular, the basic process is the same. **It’s nothing more than learning**. Learning behaviours, learning perspectives, learning models, learning how to learn.

Whatever you might desire to free yourself from when using hypnosis was learned using hypnosis. **If the effects of hypnosis were permanent, you would not be able to change!**

Oftentimes this question is asked because of the common belief that change created using hypnosis wears off after a while. It is important here to differentiate between the effects of the state that was induced using hypnosis from the effects of the interventions used while the person is in a trance.

Hypnotic trance, if there is such a thing, often feels nice and relaxing. It has been correlated with an enhanced capacity for response to suggestion. Most people come out of it feeling refreshed and comfortable. Although these effects can last up to a few days after the session, they do wear off eventually.

**Effective therapeutic work reorganizes subjective experience so that it welcomes change.** It allows change to unfold naturally in it’s new environment. Rather than influencing the symptoms, it influences the system of which they are a part.

Thus, the question should be, **does hypnosis help people change?**

Yes, it does.

...But it’s more nuanced than that.

See, people change wether they want to or not. **Our repeated actions, be they verbal, physical, or mental, make themselves more likely in the future.** In other words, the more we do, the better we become at doing. That includes actions that are not in our best interest, like being scared or forgetting important things.

Furthermore, we have a tendency to create identities around these set of repeated actions. For example, “I am a coward” or "I am someone who forgets important things”.
Then we do everything we can to preserve these identities, giving us the illusion of “not changing”, while in fact we keep changing, but in the direction of these identities.

Our repeated actions can be understood as repeated choices built into strategies. **Hypnosis helps people choose alternate strategies**, giving change a new direction.
