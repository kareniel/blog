This applies for workdays, where I spend 8 hours in front of a computer in an office setting.

I have a 1L glass bottle filled with water on my desk.
Every morning, I draw a little box for each hour of my work day on a piece of paper. I keep that piece of paper in front of me at all times. Each hour, I drink a quarter of the bottle, and check one box. *Except when I don't.*

If it's been less than 20 minutes since the hour passed, I get to check the box. Otherwise, I still drink the water, but I don't check the box.

After just one day of this, I developed the habit of looking at my piece of paper each time I look at the time. And guess what: I look at the time all the time.

I don't keep score of the past days, as I don't think it would be valuable. The hardcore data people would probably want to make crazy graphs out of it. But it's been working so well for me that the graph would be pretty flat.
