I want to open my device, whatever it is, and have an interface that influences me to do the thing that's the best for me at that specific moment.

Sometimes, I'm at the end of my workday, I want to unwind and let my mind wander for a moment. TV shows are perfect for that. For others it's video games.

Some other time, I feel on purpose, fully aligned and charged, and I feel capable of taking over the world. If my computer forces information down my throat at this moment, it's not serving my best interest.

I want to be able to open my device and choose which mode I'm in, so that it understands how to best serve me. We made computers to help us be more human. Let's design technology that supports the human in humans.
