Excellence emerges from small repeated actions. Make your bed. Brush your teeth. Meditate. Clean the kitchen. In fact, clean up as you go. Be polite. Say the truth. Be kind. Respectful. Follow a training routine. Keep the body in shape. Make it healthy.

Measure what works. Do more of it.

Again, and again, and again.

Everyday.
