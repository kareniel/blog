Here's a 5 minute process to help you get started on work outside of work. I came up with this when feeling like I didn't have enough time, yet a lot to do.

1. List 3 things you want to have done by the end of the night

2. Identify which one you feel like doing first (label it A), and which one you really ought to do (label it C)

3. Re-order your list by reverse alphabetical order

4. Separate the list in two parts:

- Part I. What I want to have done by the end of the night

  C) Work I can't not do without feeling lazy

  B) Work I'll be proud to have accomplished

- Part II. What I get to do by the end of the night

  A) Work I'm excited to work on


Get started on part I so you can have desert!
