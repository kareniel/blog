Some lessons I am learning and am intent on applying, from [Sacha Chua][1], and inspired by [Noffle][2]

## Make time

The main reason I (almost) don't blog is that I don't schedule it. Understanding the value it has should be enough to take a few minutes and add it to my calendar.

## Don't plan

I've spent so many hours preparing blog post ideas that never saw the light of day. So many hours that could have been spent actually blogging.

## Synthesize

I already spend an inordinary amount of time researching new topics. I tend to make lists out of the notions that I gather and then let them collect dust. This is a missed opportunity. During research, I can pause and synthesize ideas that are flowing through my mind in a few paragraphs. Those endless lists can be turned into full-length posts.

## Relax

A great deal of resistance comes from being scared of what others will think,
from fear of being judged.

- Keep up the rhythm and within a few month/years you will have a body of work. You will get better over time and people will forget how bad your first posts were. If they go back and look, the first posts will be understood in the context of the whole body of work. What will emerge is a sense of progression.

- Nobody actually cares.

## Complete & Hit publish

Half-finished drafts cumulate and never end up seeing the light of day. Give it an extra effort, finish the post, and publish it. If it's not very good, do better next time.
